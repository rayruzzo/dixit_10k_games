# What is Dixit?
Dixit is a creative and engaging board game that revolves around storytelling and imagination.

# Dixit Gameplay

- In Dixit, players take turns being the storyteller.
- The game is played with a deck of cards, each featuring unique and imaginative artwork.

## Turn Structure

1. **Storyteller’s Turn**:
   - The storyteller for the current round selects one card from their hand.
   - They then craft a sentence or phrase based on the image of the chosen card.
   - The storyteller shares this sentence with all other players but keeps the card hidden.

2. **Other Players’ Turns**:
   - Each of the other players selects a card from their own hand that they think best matches the storyteller’s sentence.
   - These selected cards are given to the storyteller, who shuffles them with their own card.

3. **Card Reveal**:
   - The storyteller places all shuffled cards face-up for everyone to see.

4. **Guessing**:
   - Every player, except the storyteller, secretly guesses which card they think belongs to the storyteller.

5. **Scoring**:
   - If nobody or everybody correctly guesses the storyteller’s card:
     - The storyteller scores 0 points.
     - Each other player scores 2 points.
   - If at least one player correctly guesses the storyteller’s card:
     - The storyteller and the correct guesser(s) score 3 points each.
     - Other players score 1 point for each vote their card receives.

## Game End

- The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:
  - The deck of cards is empty.
  - A player accumulates at least 30 points.

## Winning the Game

- In either case, the player with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

## Deck Information

- The Dixit base game and each expansion include 84 cards.
- You can mix and match cards from different sets as desired.

Enjoy playing Dixit and let your creativity run wild!

# Analysis Assumptions
This analysis is based on a six-player game of Dixit. Having fewer players would alter the odds of guessing accurately.

This analysis is agnostic to the individual card images and descriptions given, playing purely at random. 

Relationships between players, shared understanding, and individual creativity is not modeled in this analysis.
